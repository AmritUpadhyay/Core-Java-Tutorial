Introduction : 
When we talk about java it is one of the most popular programming language which was created in 1991, publicaly released by 1995
It was developed by James Gosling at Sun microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle.

History of Java started when James Gosling and his team (Green Team) were working on a project named Green Talk 
to develop a language for digital devices such as setup boxes , television etc .
Idea was to write once and run anywhere . During those times there was no language which has this capability.
Green team were successful in creating a language which achieved the requirement for write once and run anywhere .
They named this language as OAK - which is a symbol for strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like USA , France , Germany etc.

There was already a company named OAK which was already registered . Since we cannot use the registered name so James Gosling thought of changing name
from OAK to something else.

In 1995 James gosling and his team were sitting in a meeting room to discuss a unique name for his developed technology.
In that meeting they were served coffee which was liked by everyone and when they asked the waiter about coffee waiter said it was made of Java beans .
So in that meeting they decided to remame it to Java in 1995.
So you can see the logo of java which has a cup and coffe.
