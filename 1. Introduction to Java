Introduction : 
When we talk about java it is one of the most popular programming language which was created in 1991, publicaly released by 1995
It was developed by James Gosling at Sun microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle.

History of Java started when James Gosling and his team (Green Team) were working on a project named Green Talk 
to develop a language for digital devices such as setup boxes , television etc .
Idea was to write once and run anywhere . During those times there was no language which has this capability.
Green team were successful in creating a language which achieved the requirement for write once and run anywhere .
They named this language as OAK - which is a symbol for strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like USA , France , Germany etc.

There was already a company named OAK which was already registered . Since we cannot use the registered name so James Gosling thought of changing name
from OAK to something else.

In 1995 James gosling and his team were sitting in a meeting room to discuss a unique name for his developed technology.
In that meeting they were served coffee which was liked by everyone and when they asked the waiter about coffee waiter said it was made of Java beans .
So in that meeting they decided to remame it to Java in 1995.
So you can see the logo of java which has a cup and coffe. 


Features of Java:
Following are the notable features of Java:


-> The first and foremost reason is the platform independent feature of Java. 
Platform independent means programmers who developed their software in one platform can execute it on any platform or operating system 
regardless of underlying configuration, because of Java Virtual Machine. 
In other words, we can say that Java follows WORA rule which says Write Once Run Anywhere.

-> Object Oriented

-> Java is secure :When a new code is compiled in java, 
it converts it into a Byte-code class file which is checked by the JVM for erroneous access to unauthorised data.

-> Java also provides a multi-threading feature through which we can create multiple threads under any process which works independently and simultaneously. 
Other than these, the performance of Java is also impressive.

-> Automatic Garbage collection : is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
In C/C++, a programmer is responsible for both the creation and destruction of objects. Usually, programmer neglects the destruction of useless objects. Due to this negligence, at a certain point, 
sufficient memory may not be available to create new objects, and the entire program will terminate abnormally, causing OutOfMemoryErrors.


The execution of a Java program consists of five steps which are

1. Creation of a Java Program
2. Compiling a Java program,
3. Loading the program into the memory by Java Virtual Machine,
4. Java Virtual Machine verification for bytecode,
5. Java Program execution


Here for the first step, we need to have a java source code otherwise we won't be able to run the program you need to save it with the program.java extension.
Secondly, we need to use a compiler so that it compiles the source code which in turn gives out the java bytecode and that needs to have a program.class extension. 
The Java bytecode is a redesigned version of the java source codes, and this bytecode can be run anywhere 
irrespective of the machine on which it has been built.
